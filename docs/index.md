# What is Dunnovim?

Dunnovim is a Neovim distribution (aka. heavy configuration) that developed over time by members of TeamDunno. It is easy to use, easy to extend and easy to set up!

Speaking of which...

# Setting up

If you're on Linux, It is as simple as installing Neovim and running...

```sh
git clone https://github.com/teamdunno/nvim-starter ~/.config/nvim
cd ~/.config/nvim # will be useful for next steps
nvim
```

Dunnovim will automatically install, and will be ready for use in no time!
