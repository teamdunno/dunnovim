# Dunnovim

The repository for DunnoVim. This repository should not used directly as a configuration, see [the starter](https://github.com/teamdunno/nvim-starter)

# Some key points for this config

## Lazy

I try to lazy-load as much as possible. Not because of flexing (although it is cool), but because I hated how VSCode took around a minute to spin up on my laptop.

## Featureful

While we aim for performance at heart, we will try to squeeze as much as possible out of the editor. This means having an lsp, formatting, looks, feels, and as much niceness as possible while still having as little of a footprint as possible.

## Open

If you wish to use this config, I thank you! I am also open to contributions. **_NOTE_** that i recommend to only do this if you are comfortable with NVIM and Lua.

Before being published straight to main, we request that all features be put through a pull request. We want to do this such that things do not break for users, and can be tested safely before being pushed.
